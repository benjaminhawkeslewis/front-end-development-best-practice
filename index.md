Front End Development Best Practice
===================================

This document is a set of standards, best practices, and guidelines for front
end development. This documentation has been collated through many years
experience by a multitude of front end developers, front end architects, and
front end development managers.

<h2 id="semantic-markup">Semantic Markup</h2>

### Use HTML not XHTML

Always use HTML instead of XHTML. Whilst the well-formed nature of XHTML is certainly attractive to the markup purist, there are many reasons not to use it:

 *  To display correctly in IE, XHTML must be served with the incorrect mime-type.
 *  IE's support of XHTML can be described as "buggy" at best.
 *  `document.write` is unsupported in XHTML.
 *  `iframes` are not supported in XHTML.

In the brave new world of [HTML as a living standard](http://whatwg.org/html), the correct `DOCTYPE` to use is as follows:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
{% endhighlight %}

### No whitespace before the `DOCTYPE`

### Semantic element identifiers

<h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2>

### Baseline browser support

A-Grade experience: Test, and ensure that the visitor gets a first-class browsing and interaction experience in the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 7+ (on Windows)
* Mozilla Firefox 3.5+ (on OSX and Windows)
* Chrome 5+ (on OSX and Windows)
* Safari 5+ (on OSX)
* Opera (on Windows)

This doesn't mean the pages have to be pixel-perfect between browsers, but as close as reasonably possible to the design requirement with all of the functionality and interactivity working perfectly.

Test, and ensure that the visitor gets a useable and not-obviously-broken experience with:

* Internet Explorer 6
* Safari 4



### Use server-side browser detection and add classes

Avoid client-side libraries such as [modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) which pollutes your markup with non-semantic element identifiers.

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

### Use CSS3 presentation effects over old presentation hacks

The following effects can be done in CSS3, with no fallback when not supported in browsers (like Internet Explorer 6 & 7):

* Rounded corners with `border-radius`
* Gradient backgrounds with `background: gradient` and `background: linear-gradient`. Where possible, and when it causes no adverse effects use Microsoft's group of filters to add gradients for Internet Explorer. Also supply an appropriate default fallback background colour.
* Box shadows with `box-shadow`

Don't forget to add vendor-specific style properties where necessary.

### Use CSS hacks to work around Internet Explorer CSS issues

Where Internet Explorer 6 and 7 need extra style rules to create a non-broken browsing experience, use the underscore and/or star hacks to create IE-specific style rules. Use CSS comments to document the use of CSS hacks. 

{% highlight css %}
.module {
	float: left;
	_display: inline; /* Double margin fix for IE6 */
}
{% endhighlight %}

Keep these CSS hacks as close as possible to the rest of the styles that affect the same selector. Don't separate them into a separate IE-only stylesheet, since they will be overlooked and forgotten when the main style rules change.

### Use overflow to self-clear contained floats

Where possible use `overflow` on the containing element to clear floated elements.

{% highlight css %}
.module {
	overflow: hidden;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Where content inside of this container needs to spill out of the containing div (for example a dropdown menu near the bottom of the container), then use the content after method of clearing (using `zoom: 1` for Internet Explorer):

{% highlight css %}
.editing-panel {
	overflow: visible /* To unset a previous style-rule */
	_zoom: 1; /* self-clearing for IE */
}
.editing-panel:after {
	content: '.';
	display: block;
	clear: both;
	height: 0;
	visibility: hidden;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Add an `enhanced` class to modules or widgets

Where possible.

Otherwiseâ€¦

### Add a `js` class when JavaScript is available

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

### Use links and input buttons for clickable elements

Links and buttons are focusable and activatable by default in a browser, which means they are perceivable and operable to screen reader users and keyboard-only users. Rich JavaScript widgets (like video player controls) should be progressively enhanced on-top of elements that, by default, are already accessible.
